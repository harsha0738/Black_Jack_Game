# Black_Jack_Game
Black Jack is a most popular casino game throught the world. The Rules of Black Jack is simple.

1) Card Values:
•Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
•Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points.
•Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what is more beneficial for your hand.

2)Starting the Game:
•You place a bet to begin.
•Both you and the dealer are dealt two cards.
•The dealer shows one of their two cards face-up, while the other remains face-down (the "hole card").

3)Your Turn:
•You evaluate your two cards and decide what to do:
•Hit: Take another card to increase the value of your hand.
•Stand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.
•Double Down: Double your initial bet and receive only one more card.
•Split: If your first two cards are of the same value (e.g., two 8s), you can split them into two separate hands. Each hand is played separately, and you must match your original bet on the new hand.
•Surrender: Forfeit half your bet and end the hand early (not available in all games).

4)Winning or Losing:
•If your hand exceeds 21 points, you "bust" and lose automatically.
•After you finish your turn, the dealer reveals their hole card and follows a strict set of rules:
•If the dealer's hand is 16 or less, they must "hit" (draw another card).
•If the dealer's hand is 17 or higher, they must "stand."

5)You win if:
•Your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand.
•The dealer busts by going over 21.
